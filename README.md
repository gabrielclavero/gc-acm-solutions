# gc-acm-solutions

In this repository you can find some of my solutions to programming problems presented in the book Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual of Steven S. Skiena and Miguel A. Revillason. These are the sort of problems that you can find in programming competitions such as ACM, Facebook Hacker Cup or Google Code Jam. The simplicity or style of the code is not an important issue in this type of competitions. The only important thing is to be able to solve the problem as efficient and quickly as you can.  
You can find more problems in [http://uva.onlinejudge.org/](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/) and an online software to test your solutions or those presented here.
